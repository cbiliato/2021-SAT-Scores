"NOTE: The SAT was completely redesigned in 2016. The new SAT was first administered in March of 2016. This table reflects 2017 through 2022 high school graduates who took the new SAT during high school. These data do not factor in performance on the old SAT, and the data for 2017 set a new baseline for future year-to-year comparisons. If a student took the new SAT more than once, the most recent score on each section is used, along with the student's most recent responses to the SAT questionnaire. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
